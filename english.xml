All'età di 32 anni, Yar-Germaine decise di passare il resto della sua vita da sola nella foresta. La leggenda dice che conobbe uno spirito che viveva nella foresta, e che divenne la sua compagna per dare vita ad un figlio. Tristemente, il figlio di Yar-Germaine era brutto ed assomigliava più a una bestia che ad un mezzo-uomo. Il suo intero corpo era ricoperto da peli marroni, e più il ragazzo cresceva, più assomigliava ad una bestia feroce. Uccise innocenti che si avventurarono troppo vicino alla tana di Yar-Germaine, e così lei decise di porre fine alla vita dello sfortunato figlio. Quando lo spirito scoprì cosa aveva fatto, la strangolò. Si narra che ora si aggiri nei dintorni della tana di Yar-Germaine con lo spirito di suo figlio insieme a lui.</content>

She&apos;d holler and holler as he cried, but only the words &apos;not for you&apos; and &apos;terrible&apos; and &apos;must promise me&apos; reached his ears between his banshee-like wails.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine it! The boot of the matriarch pressed so firmly upon his neck! And those sweets just laying about, untouched by his appreciative lips!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Maradino was no tyrant&apos;s thrall; no no.

Galante&lt;br&gt;&lt;NewPage&gt; Though Cyseal&apos;s borders have shrunk considerably in modern times, ours was once an expansive kingdom of economic and strategic importance in the region of Andavale.&lt;NewPage&gt;Unembroiled in external politics, Cyseal was free to expand from sea to sea and to the borders of Luculla Forest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why, then did Cyseal fall? First: trade. As the old kingdoms grew, Cyseal&apos;s ports became less central to trading routes. But most importantly, Cyseal&apos;s history of a small and homogenous population meant that its cultural importance faded as more diverse nations grew. Capitals that featured Elvish musicians and Dwarvish mead thrived, while Cyseal&apos;s trade stagnated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, Cyseal is a seat of significant cultural importance. Home of the last Source King, the catacombs of Cyseal are famed for their beauty and their supposed preternatural activity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In recent times, the leaders of Cyseal are seeking to reinvigorate her economy. Fertile farmlands are being utilised at full capacity by the incentivised sale of lands to experienced farmers. Cyseal&apos;s future shines bright indeed.&lt;br&gt;</content>

Giggles&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Winner of the Assassins Guild&apos;s &lt;br&gt;         Brass Knuckle Award.&lt;NewPage&gt; PREFACE &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So you have determined to take a life. My sincerest congratulations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Savour this moment, friends; taste the sweetness of the feeling that grows in your belly. Soon, you will have sent a soul flying into the ether. Your hand alone will have caused the fabric of existence to have undergone a permanent and undeniable change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are preparing to undertake the most exquisite endeavour of your life, and you&apos;d be remiss not to luxuriate in every surrounding moment.&lt;NewPage&gt;CHAPTER THE FIRST: Selecting your target &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are several questions to consider when determining which life is best to seize. The following are but a few to consider: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is the head of your intended victim sufficiently round and symmetrical to make an impressive mounted trophy? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does he or she have hair of sufficient length and health to spin into a lovely yarn for darning socks or throw rugs? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will his or her hide provide for supple shoes, bags, and belts of a colour that suits your eyes?&lt;NewPage&gt;CHAPTER THE SECOND: Choosing a modus operandi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selecting the method with which to carve, strangle, or pierce your victim is in itself more a matter of art and of soul than of fact and science. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arrows are fine for sportive types. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A dagger turns the carpet red as a valentine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suffocation behoves lovers and mothers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poison complements a bitter heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end, select a method you believe best accomplishes the moral and spiritual effects you desire.&lt;NewPage&gt;CHAPTER THE THIRD: Execution&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most important and delectable step in any murder, dear reader, is the moment of execution. By this I do not mean the brute force of the violence, if a violent method you have chosen, or the interim (ever agonising) between the administration of poison and the first sign of it effects. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, the moment to which I refer is that precise event when life flees from the victim and the eyes transfigure: light to dark, flashing to still, bright to dumb. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the holy minute, the minute when the act materialises, complete -  no longer planned or attempted, but completed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the moment during which you write your name in the sky, for you have done something that, like the stars, cannot be undone.&lt;NewPage&gt;CHAPTER THE FOURTH: The Afterglow &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the moments after the execution are hardly the time to worry about practicalities; no! This is your time to quietly reflect; to enjoy your transformed self, your transformed place within the cosmos. Make yourself a cup of tea, if you please, or light a pipe. The details can wait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you find yourself fully refreshed, you might consider what to do with the once-person whose remains you must now inter or preserve, as is your pleasure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easiest and most classical means of disposal is, of course, to bury the remains, but think long and hard about precisely which remains to bury. The civilised among us know full well that waste is a sure sin, so if there is yet some function that may be wrought from the once-person&apos;s remains, it is imperative that you do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Might not a family of beggars appreciate a meaty rack of ribs? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Might not a local tanner, down on his luck, thank you for a length of virgin leather?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you not deserve some special token - a keepsake - for your labours?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once these matters have been attended to, you might concern yourself with removing the dregs of your efforts from your sight. A freshly rained-upon bog is ideal, though a freshly dug grave in your local cemetery will hardly notice a  bit of additional rubbish tucked in below the intended casket.&lt;NewPage&gt;EPILOGUE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have successfully completed your endeavour, you might find yourself wondering after and planning for the next. This is a natural and desirable result of executing, as you have learned, the perfect murder. The author wishes you luck and satisfaction as you explore your newfound passion. Remember: Until you&apos;ve reached a dozen, you&apos;ve hardly scratched the surface.</content>

By sundown, I should cross the gates of Silverglen.&lt;NewPage&gt; Day 655: The inhabitants here are somewhat queer - perhaps too eager in their love for their &apos;Conduit&apos; and their &apos;goddess,&apos; but they have been most accommodating. They say that in order to reach the village I seek, I will need to undergo a series of trials, for the passage is closely guarded. I know not yet what trials they mean, but I&apos;ll gladly suffer through anything short of death to capture Heartseeker at last.&lt;NewPage&gt;Day 656: It seems these trials were no hazard of nature, but some sort of religious ritual instead! The local abbot, a certain Loic, brought me through a series of strange tests ... one of which I thought might undo me entirely. Nevertheless, I managed, somehow, to pass the strange trial (rest in peace, innocent fowl) and now have access to the small village where Heartseeker is said to lie!&lt;NewPage&gt;Day 667: I have spent over a week inspecting the wood around the village and sneaking into every nook and cranny the place has to offer, but I have found no evidence of the legendary bow. All my work, all my research, to be led into a blind alley! Nothing for it but to pack my bags and begin anew in a fresh direction. &lt;NewPage&gt;Day 668: As I was trekking toward the village on my way to finish my affairs and begin the journey home, my weary eye caught a glimmer atop a cliff. I watched it intently and - heart in my throat - recognised Heartseeker! After years of searching, after burden after trial after setback, the bow at last! &lt;NewPage&gt;Day 669: I have tried every possible method of retrieving the bow, but it rests exactly too far in any one direction for me to reach! There&apos;s but one remaining possibility: I&apos;ll have to jump from the clifftop and snag the bow on my way to the ground below!</content>

Typically, imps are simply burned with the evening&apos;s refuse or buried alongside the dead pets of the master they served.&lt;br&gt;In rare cases, especially obedient or well-loved imps will be given traditional death rites according to the imp master&apos;s race.&lt;br&gt;In the case of embalming, imps pose no special problems. In fact, they require rather less formaldehyde than a typical man, elf, or dwarf.&lt;NewPage&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter Two: Orcs&lt;br&gt;Though their practices may appear savage to the untrained eye, death inspires a complex and sometimes beautiful aspect of orcish culture.&lt;br&gt;According to the common orcish religion, Amun-Hor, the &apos;All-Mother&apos;, receives the souls of the dead. Thus death is typically celebrated, not mourned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dead&apos;s corpse is buried immediately, and beautiful totems or other relics are erected atop the grave. These are meant to please the All-Mother when she comes for the spirit of the dead.&lt;br&gt;Next, tribe-members from toddlers to elders- the Queen included- form a great ring and, each by each,  relate a cherished memory of the deceased. Thus the life and the passing of the deceased are recalled with joy and excitement.&lt;br&gt;However, if any are caught mourning the dead, in word or by tears, the punishment is death. For surely any who would mourn the passing of a soul to the All-Mother is a traitor and a disbeliever.&lt;br&gt;</content>

And thus it happened that Rhalic, the most powerful of all gods, become the patron of the humans. The burly Duna created the dwarves in his own likeness and even lived alongside them in the mountainous caverns. Tir-Cendelius, the Poet, went into the woods and created the elves. He blessed them with near-immortality and wisdom. The reptile goddess Zorl-Stissa wished to command a proud warrior race and thus she created the lizard people - fierce fighters from the Wastelands&lt;br&gt;The God Vrogir, renowned for his brutality and violence created the orcs and enslaved them for more than three hundred years before he left Rivellon. Xantezza, the Goddess of mirth and laughter, wanted an intelligent race, versed in the arts of magic around her. She created the imps, who were talented magicians and engineers. The Goddess Amadia was an outsider, preferring to live in complete solitude. As the centuries passed the six races spread over the continent. &lt;br&gt;One day Amadia&apos;s dalliance with a wizard resulted in the birth of several demi-gods. She granted her lover immortality and decided that she would act as the patron mother of the wizards. Although wizards are not considered as a separate race, they had their own goddess to whom to pay tribute.&lt;br&gt;</content>

When will these headstrong and wilful ascendants learn that only after inner reflection and proper navigation of these halls can the necessary knowledge be unlocked. To attempt the Ritual of Devotion without it will produce only frustration and anguish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Candidate five-hundred one: Finally Edic, a young Sourcerer priest from Cyseal, made it to the first set of statues. He swiftly destroyed one of the two statues. Greatly was his surprise when he realised the statue represented his own spiritual nature. The shock that followed damaged him severely and sent him back to the beginning of the temple. He tried again later that day, but later errors of introspection eventually cost him his life. Another acolyte lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Candidate five-hundred two: At last, the Test of Self-awareness is completed! This acolyte, somewhat older than the others, gathered the books and studied them closely for hours. Thus she learned caution from those who tried and failed before her. But the riddles proved too difficult, and on the fourth day of study she  doused herself in oil and set her robes ablaze! Thus spiritual enlightenment evaded her. I, keeper of the truth, find the solution so very simple- there it rests, there in the middle of the library! So much life has been wasted in these trials, but I am bound by oath to observe and keep record alone.</content>

But what will this new world look like? I have read nearly all texts regarding Ruben Ferol, the author of the Prophecy, and the more I study his words, the more inconsistencies I find. What kind of person would this Divine One be? Will every living being see his vision for the new world, or will the Divine One select individuals? According to Prophecy, the Divine One will destroy all evil. How can lovers of creation advocate for the destruction? Can the Divine One really distinguish between good and evil? Or will he choose what is &apos;evil&apos; according to a preset moral code?</content>

This stone was capable of healing any ailment, including the terrible Rot.&lt;br&gt;Though some were sceptical that sacrificial magic could be used for good, the Conduit explained that transmitting energy from a lesser being to a greater one restores balance in the universe, and that balance is the goddess&apos; ultimate goal.&lt;br&gt;The Conduit then encouraged the healed miners to spread her good word and to continue to create Blood Stones for the purpose of promoting the greater good of higher beings. Today, we Immaculates continue to promote universal balance and the sacrifice of lesser creatures for the greater good of all.&lt;br&gt;</content>

Some say a shepherd paid an evil witch to bless his herd, but soon found his woolly friends grew a taste not for grass, but flesh. Others claim weresheep are the eternal child of the goddess of livestock and the lord of unholy necromancy.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;But one fact remains true: every passing year, their numbers dwindle. Great mystery surrounds the existence of the last remaining weresheep, but these rift-running death-dwellers are difficult to find. He who seeks his own set of weresheep armour will search a lifetime or longer before he finds what he seeks.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Rumours tell that the final weresheep, solitary in its wanderings, has been sighted only once in the last century. Its location is disclosed in a legendary scroll last seen in the Realm of Faery, free for the taking by any soul brave enough to risk the wrath of the Winter King.&lt;br&gt;</content>

Day after day he gazed from the windows of his father&apos;s home, waiting for the torrent of snow to cease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After many weeks of cold, Maradino grew impatient. Who was the winter to decide how long to stay and when to go? Shouldn&apos;t a wiser fellow, say, Maradino himself, for instance, make such an important decision?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was settled: Maradino himself would clear winter from the land, and its denizens would laud him as a hero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He swathed himself in furs and, broom in hand, set to the task of sweeping every last snowflake into the bin. He worked for many long hours, but whatever progress he made would be quickly reversed by a constant, gentle powdering from above.&lt;br&gt;Maradino wailed; Maradino stamped! He glared into the grey-white sky above him, pointed a finger straight into its colourless mass and swore: &apos;You will pay for this.&apos;&lt;br&gt;</content>

The House of Sturmgrave offered countless fearless fighters for the protection of the realm, and they were widely revered for their prowess in battle and the righteousness of their swords.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, so much were they admired that lesser lords grew green with envy. One among them refused to be second-loved among the armies or second-honoured by the queen and so hatched a plan to undo the so-called &apos;House of Heroes&apos;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lord ordered a terrible act: the pillaging and destruction of a small and peaceful town. Through careful manipulations, the wicked lord succeeded in fingering the Knights of the House of Sturmgrave as the culprits. All were tried, all found guilty by a corrupted judge, and all hanged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Knight, a mere child at the time, never forgot the gravity of the injustice. The mark of the House of Sturmgrave, the House of Heroes, was upon the youth already, and as the child&apos;s strength and honour grew, so did his desire for justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the Knight rides, a Source Hunter, leading the unrelenting charge against those who would inflict base misdeeds upon innocents.</content>

But if this be true, whether that reward shall be the solace of heaven or the agony of hell is decided during one&apos;s lifetime and therefore life is much greater than death, for it is the decision maker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what of those who care not for the gods, who question the afterlife; the existence of deities? Life is life&apos;s own goal they say; a wise sentiment I echo, and that even priests would do well to heed. But O how often does doubt assail these revellers of life! How often does fear approach with the creeping of the shadows... So great becomes the looming horror that death becomes larger than life and death becomes the greater force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forget the promise of gods I say, but defy the fear of oblivion as well, for only if life and death become each other&apos;s equals can the philosophy of death become one of life. Death is the instigator of faith and fear, but only if you let it be so. If you can gaze into its obsidian eyes, knowing it is the be all and the end all, but fear neither, then shall you have reached the shores of wisdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So sayeth Nemris.</content>

The fleet-footed Shadowblade escaped, but the rest of the village did not. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a wandering orphan, thieves, beggars, pirates, and murderers taught the Shadowblade that man was no more than a beast, and the laws of nature were simple: Kill or be killed; eat or go hungry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a survivor among survivors needed an advantage. Posing as the child of nobleman, it was almost easy to gain access to the Academy of the Source Hunters. Here the most elite secrets of magic were offered freely, and the Shadowblade perfected them all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the time the ruse was discovered, it was too late. The academy had a prized pupil, and the Shadowblade had found that hunting Sourcerers satisfied the soul better than picking pockets. Usually.</content>

The tale goes that Sir Brightsturm himself had imbued it with the tormented soul of a ghost. How he would go about that, no one may ever know, but it did make him hit harder, and he could sense when and where strikes and arrows were going to land. Unfortunately, successful though Sir Brightsturm may have been, the magic could not save his life. On the contrary: it had one drawback. Wielding the sword made his body carry a heavy burden, and as soon as he would leave the battlefield, he would appear an old, worn down man. Tired, sickly. Strong as he may have been, his body one day couldn&apos;t take it anymore, and he died a young man in an old body.</content>

When one of their kind, Braccus Rex, came to power, he instigated a war that would have undone Rivellon if not for the Council of Seven.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These wise rulers ordered a new order of elite warriors especially trained to fight the Source menace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Braccus was defeated, and the Order of the Source Hunters began its legacy. Our objective is to eradicate the Source menace from Rivellon, one Sourcerer at a time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recognising Source&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike other forms of magic, Source is particularly difficult to identify. Mages of many years&apos; experience may learn to sense the presence of Source, as others smell the sick-sweet scent of poison or hear the barely-perceptible scrape of a sword loosened from its hilt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source may be channelled through certain objects-- weapons, gems, or metals. These are unpredictable as Source itself and may inflict terrible harm or magnificent feats of healing upon either wielder or target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methodology of the Source Hunter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ours is an order of cunning and cleverness as much as strength and power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The well-trained Source Hunter will examine and question- lift every barrel and analyse each testimony for the faintest breath of a clue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing is insurmountable. If some knot puzzles you, mark its location upon your map and return to it when you&apos;ve learned a better method of untangling it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are no limits to a Source Hunter&apos;s resolve. No riddle is unknowable; no foe unbeatable; no mystery unsolvable.&lt;br&gt;</content>

Ample rain followed by a relatively dry season produces an excellent barley.&lt;br&gt;2) Once harvested, the barley must be milled to create grist. &lt;br&gt;3) Mix the grist with well water and it will fast become a rich, brown wort.&lt;br&gt;4) Increase the wort&apos;s alcoholic content by way of a pot still. This distillation process will leave you with a lovely spirit.&lt;br&gt;5) And now: patience! Allow the spirit to age over the course of several decades to create a drink worthy of the finest of guests.&lt;br&gt;</content>

Night after night I find myself drawn into esoteric tomes, convinced, perhaps foolishly, that one will yield the kernel I need. The eternal secret. If it is to be found, I will find it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;22 Aventuris&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A monumental day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my searching, I uncovered a tome containing the arcane mythology of those wretched Sourcerer Kings who nearly undid all of Rivellon. These myths, once widely-believed by credulous peasants, have long been dismissed and discredited. Still, I promised myself that I&apos;d leave no stone unturned in my pursuit of knowledge. &lt;br&gt;The volume looked as though it&apos;d received the same treatment as the barbaric King Braccus - whipped, burned, left to dangle in the wind, and hastily buried.&lt;br&gt;The tome, The Book of the Immaculates, it&apos;s called, claimed most insistently that Star Stone, a petty crystal, could be imbued with the essence of life and used to heal men - even those teetering on the brink of death. &lt;br&gt;At first I dismissed the proclamation as superstition. Still, as the hours wore on, the idea began to seem less and less ridiculous. These stones - mere shards, most often- appear in more than one mythology. Here the fallen tears of the Almighty, there the rejected stars of the Cosmos- no matter the fiction, they always seem to retain some otherworldly origin.&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, a Star Stone was hardly difficult to come by; I wrenched a shard the length of my finger from an old dagger passed down to me by generations of Hashnitors before me. I inspected it closely, but still, no special properties appeared to my naked eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book&apos;s instructions were clear enough, and I followed them exactly. It was no pleasure to slit the throat of one of Bertia&apos;s panicked roosters, but when I held in my hand a Star Stone turned from a dull blue to a deep, swirling red, a stone that seemed to throb, alive, in my very hand, the discomfort of the sacrifice vanished entirely.&lt;br&gt;Blood Stone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;15 Junar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&apos;m not too modest to say my renown has spread far. Who else can heal the sick, the wounded, the nearly-dead within a matter of minutes? Who else can return the spirit of life to a vessel nearly undone?&lt;br&gt;And what about a vessel that has been undone?&lt;br&gt;Though I have yet to make the attempt, I grow curious about the stone&apos;s true power. If it can heal wounds of every make and manner, might it also heal the ultimate wound? Might it also reverse death?&lt;br&gt;Even now, as I write, her smoke and spices haunt me. Malia calls to me. She wants to come home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;20 Junar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A strange guest has joined me.&lt;br&gt;She said she knew of my method and that she, messenger of &apos;the goddess,&apos; could help me achieve new heights of healing... as long as I promised to serve her. Naturally, my first guess was that she&apos;d been touched by madness. Me, serve some false prophet? Unlikely.&lt;br&gt;But despite her claims, the woman, calling herself &apos;the Conduit&apos; does seem to know how to manipulate Blood Stone in astounding ways. &lt;br&gt;On her first night here, she took me at midnight to a forgotten cemetery outside Cyseal&apos;s walls. I carried the shovel, she the Blood Stone. &lt;br&gt;Before morning&apos;s first light, and to my amazement, she had raised a long-decayed skeleton into a walking automaton. The creature was grotesque, no more alive now than it had been for the last hundred years, but animated none-the-less.&lt;br&gt;I must wonder, after what I&apos;ve seen, if this mysterious stranger might hold the key I&apos;ve been looking for. Life after death... life beyond death... the idea has set my mind ablaze.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;20 Vernis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has promised me everything (that is to say, the only thing) I have ever wanted. The Conduit says that she knows the secret to reanimating a corpse not only with life, but with soul. She knows I would do anything to earn this information but since I would not be fooled by her little act as some goddess&apos; messenger, she has asked me to earn her secret in another way.&lt;br&gt;I have now laboured for the Conduit a full month and have made surprising headway toward fulfilling her request. Soon enough my end of the bargain will be complete, and then will come hers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;27 Vernis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The path that leads toward Braccus Rex is terrible and twisted, fraught with fiends, each more horrible than the last. But I seek them each by each, and I raise them one by one, and every second I stare into their vile, hell-sent face brings me closer to him.&lt;br&gt;I will speak to the Source King. I will wrench from him the secret the Conduit so craves. And when I present it to her, she will give me what I desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5 Vernis&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can it be that a year has passed? How could I have been so close to finding Braccus Rex, yet so impossibly far from him? How long must Cyseal suffer the plague of undead I have unleashed upon their doors in my pursuit?&lt;br&gt;The Conduit has grown impatient and sent her watch-dog Evelyn to make sure I am adhering to my promise. The daggers she sets upon me with her every gaze will hardly hasten my progress; I am as desperate as anyone to raise the Source King.&lt;br&gt;</content>

He decided to marry a very wealthy woman from Verdistis. She was considered ugly by many people and suffered countless cruel comments about her large and bloated face. After the marriage, the merchant did strangle her and bury her body in his garden. Several years passed and the wealthy merchant lived a carefree life. A mighty apple tree grew on the very spot of her grave and the apples looked delicious. One day the merchant went to the tree, plucked an apple and eat it. Within minutes the heartless merchant dropped dead. Mages who investigated his death were dumbfounded when they discovered that the apples had magical properties and contained a most rare and deadly poison.</content>

If you have already learned the basic techniques you can easily distinguish the beginners from the experts. A beginner does not know how to hold a sword properly and his fighting stance is completely unbalanced. The bravados are versed in the arts of sword fighting but they reveal their knowledge merely through exhibition. You can find many bravados at fairs where they demonstrate their skills in front of the excited masses. A real sword master is a mentor who travels from town to town to teach his skills but he will always hide his best tricks. A true sword master will teach you everything you know...not everything he knows.</content>

To be alone in the darkness of these haunted woods meant certain death, but there was nowhere to turn for shelter. Nearly resigned to fate, the Warrior&apos;s eye caught something... a distant light through the trees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Warrior approached, and bit by bit the gentle glow became a campfire. A wizard sat nearby, holding his thin hands to the small flame. Approaching cautiously, the Warrior asked for shelter, and the wizard was happy to oblige.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two became both friends and tutors, and the Warrior learned several of the wizard&apos;s finest spells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they travelled, they happened upon a cave from which a terrible groaning echoed. The Warrior went in first, inching along the cold cave wall as the groaning grew louder. Deep within, a figure, half-woman and half-demon, writhed upon the floor. A Sourcerer possessed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Warrior turned to escape, but it was too late- the Sourcerer screeched and cast a deadly spell. But before it could find its target, the wizard threw himself in its path.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Warrior- now a Battlemage and a Source Hunter- never forgot the wizard, nor the magic he&apos;d left behind.</content>

Prohibited from tinkering with his mother&apos;s matchbox, Maradino nevertheless dreamt of the day he&apos;d be able to master a flame of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he began his studies into the arcane wizarding arts, he came upon a spell that quite fascinated him. Ignia Capul it was called, and it promised to introduce his supple, growing mind to a world of magical fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maradino studied the spell long into the night. As the sun crested upon the horizon, he determined to try what he had learned. Carefully, precisely, he spoke the words on the page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A warm sensation came over him; was it the fire of knowledge? The power of the academic flame within? No- it was his very hair blazing and burning ever-higher into the early morning. Maradino shrieked and dunked his head into his basin; he never attempted the spell again.&lt;br&gt;</content>

Bits of crumbling pages stick to your fingers as you turn each page.*&lt;br&gt;A Pirate&apos;s Life&lt;br&gt;Shipmate Faulkerson&apos;s Diary&lt;br&gt;Whoever came up with the idea to go hunting for treasure in Cyseal should be keelhauled. I cared not for diaries before we ended up in this accursed place. As I fear the end is nigh, I feel obliged to warn my fellow pirates: AVOID CYSEAL.&lt;br&gt; As sunny as its beaches are, as golden as the sun shines its cobblestone roads, equally corrupt is this hellhole.&lt;br&gt;There are laws for everything in Cyseal, and every law contradicts the other. The beginning we tried to work alongside the system for some time- better to ease down the locals&apos; suspicions, you see. But I fear every trader that sets foot in Cyseal must become a pirate or an outlaw, whether they realize it or not. &lt;br&gt;There are taxes on docking a ship. There are taxes on owning a ship. There are taxes on docking without a ship. There are taxes on boarding and unboarding the ship, but one cannot unboard without having boarded in Cyseal first. Oi! What&apos;s it even mean?&lt;br&gt;There are taxes on entering the tavern if you&apos;re not a Cysealean. And there&apos;s a law against entering the tavern if you ain&apos;t a Cysealian. Unaware, you enter, pay the tax, and then get thrown in jail when the locals realise your anchor&apos;s set elsehwere!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that&apos;s not the worst part. We came here looking for treasure. There is a skull-shaped cave on the beach, and the Captain is certain there&apos;s a pirate&apos;s bounty within. We have sent out a dozen of our best men a fortnight ago, but they&apos;ve yet to return. The rumour amongst our men is that the cave is haunted. Hogwash! The rest of us&apos;ll investigate tomorrow, if our crew has not returned. Then it&apos;s &apos;Goodbye, Cyseal!&apos;&lt;br&gt;</content>
